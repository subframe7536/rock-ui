# Future

- [ ] invalid state should become `data-*` driven css instead of a variant in cva
- [ ] refactor: overlay components should consider children as content, and provider optional trigger prop
- [ ] custom true/false value in form elements
- [ ] polish theme, like ring color etc.
- [ ] transform to tailwind class syntax, optional unocss transform to simplify
- [ ] inline and drop kobalte
  - [ ] bug: When the pointer moves from that parent item toward the submenu, the submenu closes too early before the pointer can reach it, because a different sibling menu item becomes highlighted/triggered during the pointer movement.
  - [ ] animated collapsible component
  - [ ] slider thumb overlapped, should allow to slide to any direction
- [ ] refine demo into doc?
