- [x] extend avatar size variant like other components
- [x] refactor all transformer with `oxc-parser` / `oxc-walk`, add missing keyframes in `tw3.css` / `tw4.css`
- [x] remove all unocss-specific class syntax and option to simplify by transformer, provide preset
- [x] simplify theme
- [ ] unify icon size resolver
- [ ] `styles: SlotStyles<SlotNames, JSX.CSSProperties>` (like `classes`)
- [ ] check `props.highlight` actual usage and style effect, optimize `surface-highlight` and `surface-outline` and `surface-overlay`, unify text size / line height / spacing / border color , border implement style (directly border or box-shadow)

# V1

- [ ] NavigationMenu

  - [ ] Collapsible component 's content height has not transition
  - [ ] When slider thumb overlapped, should allow to slide to any direction
  - [ ] No keyboard loop option in tab
